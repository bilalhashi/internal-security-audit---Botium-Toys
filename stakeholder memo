Recommendations

Botium Toys will need to comply and adhere to the regulations below:

General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
•	GDPR is a European Union (E.U.) general data regulation that protects the processing of E.U. residents’ data and their right to privacy in and out of E.U. territory. For example, if an organization is not being transparent about the data they are holding about an E.U. citizen and why they are holding that data, this is an infringement that can result in a fine to the organization. Additionally, if a breach occurs and an E.U. citizen’s data is compromised, they must be informed. The affected organization has 72 hours to notify the E.U. citizen about the breach.
o	Botium Toys has a growing online presence that has now reached a global market, which includes the EU. They’re now responsible for handling the personal and financial information of EU citizens, so it’s imperative to adhere to the regulations of the GDPR to ensure the data is safe.

Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
•	PCI DSS is an international security standard meant to ensure that organizations storing, accepting, processing, and transmitting credit card information do so in a secure environment. The objective of this compliance standard is to reduce credit card fraud. 
o	PCI DSS sets comprehensive security standards for handling cardholder data during transactions. Adhering to these standards helps prevent data breaches, reducing the risk of customer information being compromised. Botium Toys has frequent online transactions, making it a must to adhere to PCI DSS. 

System and Organizations Controls (SOC type 1, SOC type 2)
•	The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants® (AICPA) auditing standards board developed this standard. The SOC1 and SOC2 are a series of reports that focus on an organization's user access policies at different organizational levels such as Associate, Supervisor, Manager, Executive, Vendor and Others. They are used to assess an organization’s financial compliance and levels of risk. They also cover confidentiality, privacy, integrity, availability, security, and overall data safety. Control failures in these areas can lead to fraud.
o	It is favourable for Botium Toys to comply because SOC Type 1 and SOC Type 2 reports are important for businesses to demonstrate their commitment to data security, risk management, and the overall effectiveness of their internal controls. Adhering to SOC standards can help build trust with customers, meet regulatory requirements, improve risk management, and strengthen business relationships. Prioritizing compliance, security and integrity strengthens an organization’s posture.

Botium Toys will not need to comply and adhere to the regulations below:

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission - North American Electric Reliability Corporation (FERC-NERC)
•	FERC-NERC is a regulation that applies to organizations that work with electricity or that are involved with the U.S. and North American power grid. These types of organizations have an obligation to prepare for, mitigate, and report any potential security incident that can negatively affect the power grid. They are also legally required to adhere to the Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP) Reliability Standards defined by the FERC. 
o	These regulations are aimed at organizations that work with electricity or power grids and are required to report security incidents that affect the power grids. Botium Toys does not fall under these requirements.


The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)
•	HIPAA is a U.S. federal law established in 1996 to protect patients' health information. This law prohibits patient information from being shared without their consent. It is governed by three rules: Privacy, Security and Breach Notification. Organizations that store patient data have a legal obligation to inform patients of a breach because if patients' Protected Health Information (PHI) is exposed, it can lead to identity theft and insurance fraud. PHI relates to the past, present, or future physical or mental health or condition of an individual, whether it’s a plan of care or payments for care. Along with understanding HIPAA as a law, security professionals also need to be familiar with the Health Information Trust Alliance (HITRUST®), which is a security framework and assurance program that helps institutions meet HIPAA compliance.
o	Botium Toys is not required to adhere to HIPAA because it’s not a business that provides any health care services. The sole purpose of the organization is to sell toys physically and online.
